# The Bindings model is a model of Key to Producer mappings (bindings).
# The central concept is that a Bindings is a nested structure of bindings.
# A top level Bindings should be a NamedBindings (the name is used primarily
# in error messages). A Key is a Type/Name combination.

# TODO: In this version, references to "any object" uses the class Object,
