  #   These issues are set as constants, but it is unfortunately not possible for the created object to easily know which
  #   name it is bound to. Instead the constant has to be repeated. (Alternatively, it could be done by instead calling
  #   #const_set on the module, but the extra work required to get yardoc output vs. the extra effort to repeat the name
  #   twice makes it not worth it (if doable at all, since there is no tag to artificially construct a constant, and
  #   the parse tag does not produce any result for a constant assignment).
