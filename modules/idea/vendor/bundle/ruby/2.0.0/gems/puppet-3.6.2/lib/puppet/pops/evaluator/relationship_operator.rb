# The RelationshipOperator implements the semantics of the -> <- ~> <~ operators creating relationships or notification
# relationships between the left and right hand side's references to resources.
#
# This is separate class since a second level of evaluation is required that transforms string in left or right hand
# to type references. The task of "making a relationship" is delegated to the "runtime support" class that is included.
# This is done to separate the concerns of the new evaluator from the 3x runtime; messy logic goes into the runtime support
# module. Later when more is cleaned up this can be simplified further.
#
class Puppet::Pops::Evaluator::RelationshipOperator

  # Provides access to the Puppet 3.x runtime (scope, etc.)
  # This separation has been made to make it easier to later migrate the evaluator to an improved runtime.
