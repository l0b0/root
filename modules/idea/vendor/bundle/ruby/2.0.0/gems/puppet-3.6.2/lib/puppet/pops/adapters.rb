  # A SourcePosAdapter holds a reference to  a *Positioned* object (object that has offset and length).
  # This somewhat complex structure makes it possible to correctly refer to a source position
  # in source that is embedded in some resource; a parser only sees the embedded snippet of source text
  # and does not know where it was embedded. It also enables lazy evaluation of source positions (they are
  # rarely needed - typically just when there is an error to report.
  #
  # @note It is relatively expensive to compute line and position on line - it is not something that
  #   should be done for every token or model object.
