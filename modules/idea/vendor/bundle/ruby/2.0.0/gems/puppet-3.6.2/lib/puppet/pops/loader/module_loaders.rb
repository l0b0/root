# =ModuleLoaders
# A ModuleLoader loads items from a single module.
# The ModuleLoaders (ruby) module contains various such loaders. There is currently one concrete
# implementation, ModuleLoaders::FileBased that loads content from the file system.
# Other implementations can be created - if they are based on name to path mapping where the path
# is relative to a root path, they can derive the base behavior from the ModuleLoaders::AbstractPathBasedModuleLoader class.
#
# Examples of such extensions could be a zip/jar/compressed file base loader.
#
# Notably, a ModuleLoader does not configure itself - it is given the information it needs (the root, its name etc.)
# Logic higher up in the loader hierarchy of things makes decisions based on the "shape of modules", and "available
# modules" to determine which module loader to use for each individual module. (There could be differences in
# internal layout etc.)
#
# A module loader is also not aware of the mapping of name to relative paths - this is performed by the
# included module Puppet::Pops::Loader::PathBasedInstantatorConfig which knows about the map from type/name to
# relative path, and the logic that can instantiate what is expected to be found in the content of that path.
